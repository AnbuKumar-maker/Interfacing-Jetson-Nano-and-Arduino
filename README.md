# Interfacing-Jetson-Nano-and-Arduino
I have documented steps to interface Arduino with Jetson Nano. This is important for building Autonomous Robots or Self Driving Car where in you just cannot drive the motors using only Jetson Nano, you need a seperate MCU like Arduino to talk to Jetson in serial interface and drive the motors based on the Jetson communication
